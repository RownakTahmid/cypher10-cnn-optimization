# cypher10-cnn-optimization
PyTorch CNN experiments on Cypher10 dataset with multiple architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization strategies.

This repository contains experiments on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the Cypher10 dataset (CIFAR-10 equivalent) using PyTorch. It includes multiple CNN architectures, dropout and MaxPooling variations, optimizer comparisons (Adam, SGD), and evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall. Training and validation losses are tracked to detect overfitting. Includes notebooks, results, saved models, and dependencies for reproducibility.
